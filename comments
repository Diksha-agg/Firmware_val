velocity is nearly same as visible in qgc
but when it flies with different velocities, it shows different from qgc alot
now lift is cal using this vel actualy speed
liftI is cal using velocity direction which is creating problems
vel is going in that dir becoz of lift first

if system is controlled then is it abletofly nicely  straightforward wihtout gg
tocontrol it will change the vel of rotors and it will change the lift 
inflow will change and thus lift and so if rotor vel is different then they will be different lifts and thus they might yw 
why vel for 2 wings are different

without any lift,its going straight and the vel nearlymatch
but still the lift calculation is showing diff answer becoz the rotor will rotate at diff rpm to make it stable and thus lift will be different

if it tries to make it stable the vel of rotor will be different and thus lift will be different and it will produce yaw 

when lift is on then first lift will try to pitch it and and in stablizing that the rotor iwll produce different rpms and thus different lift and it will automatically yaw which shud be controlled by ailerons 

n flight check the
